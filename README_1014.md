# GitHub Collaboration Workflow (My work in this project)

Our team used GitHub features to collaborate efficiently:

 => My Contribution: 

I contributed to the development of the 10-Day Forecast and Today's Forecast features. My work focused on building and updating the todayforecast.html and 10dayforecast.html pages, including both the design and weather data integration.

As part of the GitHub collaboration process, I:

1. Created and worked on feature branches for both forecast pages

2. Made multiple commits with clear messages

3. Merged changes into the main branch through pull requests

4. Resolved merge conflicts that occurred during integration

5. Used .gitignore to ignore unnecessary or sensitive files
